# This Is My Personal Nix System Builds

This allows for easy backups of how my computer is built.
If I ever need to build my computer from scratch (again), then I just run 

```shell
nixos-install --flake <github-url>
```

# TODOs

- [ ] Build a simple VM machine first
- [ ] next build a container
- [ ] build a home server
- [ ] build a home NAS box with NixOS
